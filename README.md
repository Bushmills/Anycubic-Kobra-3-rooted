In this repo will I describe the steps necessary to:
 - gain root access to the Kobra 3 over network
 - copy files (expecially: rendered gcode files) over the network to Kobra 3

This serves to avoid having to use the (rather unreliable) "cloud" access to feed
the printer with data, while allowing use of a locally running slicer.

Steps are described and organised as wiki pages:

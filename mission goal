- Connectivity of the Kobra 3 is, out of the box, poor.
   Albeit mine is an early model, and firmware likely to change in future, it required me to either sneakernet rendered gcode file, or go
through "the cloud" with the printer connected to over WiFi. None of these were satisfactory options.

- Network:
   only WiFi connection, 2.4 GHz, through a local AP is possible. No USB, no ethernet.
   When connected, only a single port is exposed: 5555
   Klipper hosts or locally running slicers can't connect to the Kobra 3

- Goal:
   Allow a slicer of choice to transfer rendered gcode files to the printer, across network, while printer being permanently
ready to receive files.
